                  Workshop 2(Weather)

Logic#1(Pseudocode for Mixed only)

1. Enter the value for mixed type of precipitation accumulation in cm.

2. Enter the temperature value in degree.

3. If the precipitation accumulation is less than or equal to 3.5cm:
	3.1 No action is required

4. If the precipitation accumulation is between 3.5 to 5.75cm, then check the temperature:
	4.1 If the temperature is below -15.0:
		4.1.1 deploy 1 plow truck and 1 sand trucks with light application rate.
	4.2 If the temperature is between -15.0 to -7.0:
		4.2.1 deploy 1 plow truck and 1 salt truck with light application rate.
	4.3 If the temperature is above -7.0:
		4.3.1 deploy 1 plow truck only.
	
5. If the precipitation accumulation is between 5.75 to 16.5cm, then check the temperature:
	5.1 If the temperature is below -15.0:
		5.1.1 deploy 1 plow truck with 1 heavy application rate sand truck.
	5.2 If the temperature is between -15.0 to -7.0:
		5.2.1 deploy 1 plow truck with 1 heavy application rate salt truck.
	5.3 If the temperature is above -7.0:
		5.3.1 deploy 1 plow truck with 1 normal application rate salt truck.

6. If the precipitation accumulation is between 16.5 to 40.0cm, then check the temperature:
	6.1 If the temperature is below -15.0:
		6.1.1 deploy 2 plow trucks with 1 (heavy) sand truck.
	6.2 If the temperature is between -15.0 to -7.0:
		6.2.1 deploy 2 plow trucks with 1 salt truck(heavy).
	6.3 If the temperature is above -7.0:
		6.3.1 deploy 2 plow trucks with 1 (light) salt truck.

7. If the precipitation accumulation is greater than 40.0cm:
	7.1 announce the state of emergency and organize army and jurisdiction support.

8. .Display the output actions according to the input conditions entered by the user.
