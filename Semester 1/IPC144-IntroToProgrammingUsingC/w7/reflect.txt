1. I was successful in coding the non-repetitive sections of logic in the game by using if-else statements, arrays and do-while loops. I mainly did comparison using the if-else statements with equals to (=) operator, then I did multiple iterations using do-while loop and then for assigning position to character I used arrays.

2. With the use of structures, my program was able to simplify a lot because with the help of structs I can make my own inter-related data structures which similar purpose. Alternative, I could have used variables or arrays instead of using structs but that would have made the code very big, repetitive and unrelated.

3. The maximum number of nesting in the code which I ended up using is 3:
  do {
		
		for (k = 0; k < game.path_length; k++)
		{
			if (current_position[k] == 'V')
			{
				count_char++;
			}
		}
		if (count_char == 0)
		{
			printf("\n");
		}
		else
		{
			printf("  ");
			for (k = 0; k < game.path_length; k++)
			{
				if (current_position[k] == 'V')
				{
					printf("%c\n", current_position[k]);
        }
      }
    }
  }
