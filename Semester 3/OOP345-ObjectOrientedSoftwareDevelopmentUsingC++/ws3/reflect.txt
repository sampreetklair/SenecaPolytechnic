OOP345 - Workshop 3 - Reflection

By completing this workshop I learned how to design and successfully implement a class template and how useful it can be for using the same piece of code for multiple times. I learned how we can pass typename or a class as a template variable and can declare a variable that is being replaced by it at multiple places. I also learned how to derive a class template from another class template and how it can be useful. Overall, I learned that templates are like flexible blueprints for creating versatile classes which can be used again and again at multiple places inside our code.
