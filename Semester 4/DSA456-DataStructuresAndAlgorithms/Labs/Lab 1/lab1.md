# Reflection for Lab 1

1. The thing I liked the most about Python programming language is the high-level nature of it. There are things in other programming languages like C and C++ that require a plethora of code and understanding of various other concepts like pointers, references, allocation and deallocation of memory, etc. which in a high-level language like python the programmer does not need to care about and is taken care by the language itself.

2. When I started to code in python there was one thing that behaved differently than I expected, and that was how we declare and treat the variables. In C++, while declaring variables, we also declare their data type which contrasts with python where we do not need to specify the data type of a variable when declaring it. Secondly, in C++ we treat variables as a collection of memory (bytes), whereas in python we treat variables as a label to our data.

3. The things I found similar in C++ and Python are:
    - The if-else statements, loops and functions in C++ and Python have a very similar functioning and working to each which makes them easier to understand.
    - Both programming languages have a similar object oriented programming nature, making it better for modular programming by the use of classes and objects

    The things I found different in C++ and Python are:
    - C++ is a compiled language, whereas Python is an interpreted language which makes both of them different in functioning. The C++ code is first compiled into a translation unit which is then converted to machine code, but the python code is translated directly into machine code at runtime.
    - As mentioned earlier, I found variable declaration very different in C++ and Python. In C++, we declare the data type along with declaration of the variable. But, in python, we do not declare the data type, the programming language automatically figures it out by the data we enter in the variable itself.

    The impact these have made on the way I write my program is that now I can focus more on working on the solution to the given problem instead of worrying about different concepts like pointers, references, allocation and deallocation of memory, and even variable data type declaration that sometimes led to compile-time or run-time errors. Additionally, in python there is no need to compile the code, which has resulted in faster development and debugging of code.
