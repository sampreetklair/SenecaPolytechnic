# Lab 0



## LaTex Formulas

1. $$c = {\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}$$
2. $$\sum_{i=0}^{n}ar^i$$
3. $${\sum_{i=1}^{n}i} = {1+2+3+4+\cdots n} = {n(n+1)\over2}$$

## Reflection here

1. The hardest aspect of lab0 for me was setting up the GitHub Repository and GitHub CodeSpaces. This was the first course in which we are using these technologies and because these were new and unfamiliar to me, I found it bit challenging. Another thing I found difficult at first was using the LaTex formatting and writing mathematical expressions using it.

2. I think CodeSpaces is a very useful tool for programmers and it makes setting up environment for a new programming language hassle free. The thing I liked the most about CodeSpaces is that we do not need to download a compiler or interpreter and setup our local environment when learning a new programming language, it does all this for us. Additionally, for accessing CodeSpaces we do not need to create another account and we can just start working on our files using the existing repositories we have created.
